# Layouting Phylogenetic Networks using MIQP
In this research project, the goal was to explore the use of Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) to lay out phylogenetic networks. Our goal was to create an objective function and constraints that accurately capture the quality of a network and can be optimised to using IBM Ilog CPLEX.


The code and data including the final report is avialable.
